normally called 'store', but it's more b/c it does api stuff, graphql, workflows, compilcated business logic. /Engine/.

not just state management.



the more semantic your actions are, the looser your reducers are coupled to your actions


bad:
myAct(a, b, c, c,d adsf,a sdf, )

reducer(action) {
	return logic dependeing on all those params
}

good:

myAct()

reducer(action) { return self-defined logic based on just the action type}











So I was struggling to try to write a reducer enhancer to support 'loading' and 'errored' states.
But /Promises/. I think the solution is that the value of the state can be a promise that resolves to the state shape.

Then in React componetn or selector or wherever, you can natively use whether the promise is resolved, pending, or thrown.

in React, there's something sick called "suspense." can't wait for it.
